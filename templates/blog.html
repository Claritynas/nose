         <p id="database" class="passage"><u>What is Database?</u>  <br>
            
            A database is an organized collection of data, so that it can be easily accessed and managed. <br>
            
            
            
            You can organize data into tables, rows, columns, and index it to make it easier to find relevant information.
            
            Database handlers create a database in such a way that only one set of software program provides access of data to all the users.
            
            The main purpose of the database is to operate a large amount of information by storing, retrieving, and managing data. <br>
            <img src="{% static 'images\what-is-database.webp' %}" height="300" width="800" alt=""> <br>
            
            There are many dynamic websites on the World Wide Web nowadays which are handled through databases. For example, a model that checks the availability of rooms in a hotel.
            It is an example of a dynamic website that uses a database.
            
            There are many databases available like MySQL, Sybase, Oracle, MongoDB, Informix, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.
             
            Modern databases are managed by the database management system (DBMS). <br>
           
            
            SQL or Structured Query Language is used to operate on the data stored in a database. SQL depends on relational algebra and tuple relational calculus.
            
            A cylindrical structure is used to display the image of a database.
            
            database <br>
            Evolution of Databases <br>
            The database has completed more than 50 years of journey of its evolution from flat-file system to relational and objects relational systems.
             It has gone through several generations. <br>
            
            The Evolution <br>
            
            1968 was the year when File-Based database were introduced. In file-based databases, data was maintained in a flat file. Though files have many advantages, there are several limitations.
            
            One of the major advantages is that the file system has various access methods, e.g., sequential, indexed, and random.
            
            It requires extensive programming in a third-generation language such as COBOL, BASIC. <br>
            <img src="{% static 'images\Hierarchy-of-Data-in-a-Database-Copy-2-min.jpg' %}" height="400" width="800" alt=""> <br>
            Hierarchical Data Model <br>
            1968-1980 was the era of the Hierarchical Database. Prominent hierarchical database model was IBM's first DBMS. It was called IMS (Information Management System).
            
            
            In this model, files are related in a parent/child manner.
            
            Below diagram represents Hierarchical Data Model. Small circle represents objects.
            
            database 2 <br>
            Like file system, this model also had some limitations like complex implementation, lack structural independence, can't easily handle a many-many relationship, etc.
           <br>
            
            Network data model <br>
            Charles Bachman developed the first DBMS at Honeywell called Integrated Data Store (IDS).
             It was developed in the early 1960s, but it was standardized in 1971 by the CODASYL group (Conference on Data Systems Languages).
            
            In this model, files are related as owners and members, like to the common network model.
            
            <br>
            Network data model identified the following components:
            <br>
            <img src="{% static 'images\database.jpeg' %}" height="400" width="800" alt=""> <br>
            
            Network schema (Database organization) <br>
            Sub-schema (views of database per user) <br>
            Data management language (procedural) <br>
            This model also had some limitations like system complexity and difficult to design and maintain. <br>
            
            Relational Database <br>
            1970 - Present: It is the era of Relational Database and Database Management. In 1970, the relational model was proposed by E.F. Codd.
            
            Relational database model has two main terminologies called instance and schema.
            
            The instance is a table with rows or columns
            
            Schema specifies the structure like name of the relation, type of each column and name.
            
            <br>
            
            This model uses some mathematical concept like set theory and predicate logic.
            
            The first internet database application had been created in 1995.
            
            During the era of the relational database, many more models had introduced like object-oriented model, object-relational model, etc.
            <br>
            Cloud database <br>
            Cloud database facilitates you to store, manage, and retrieve their structured, unstructured data via a cloud platform. This data is accessible over the Internet. Cloud databases are also called a database as service (DBaaS) because they are offered as a managed service.
            <br>
            Some best cloud options are: <br>
            <img src="{% static 'images\gettyimages-1463092481-170667a.jpg' %}" height="400" width="800" alt=""> <br>
            
            AWS (Amazon Web Services) <br>
            Snowflake Computing <br>
            Oracle Database Cloud Services <br>
            Microsoft SQL server <br>
            Google cloud spanner <br>
            Advantages of cloud database <br>
            
            Lower costs <br>
            
            
            Generally, company provider does not have to invest in databases. It can maintain and support one or more data centers.
            
            Automated
            
            Cloud databases are enriched with a variety of automated processes such as recovery, failover, and auto-scaling. <br>
            
            Increased accessibility <br>
            
            You can access your cloud-based database from any location, anytime. All you need is just an internet connection.
            <br>
            
            NoSQL Database <br>
            A NoSQL database is an approach to design such databases that can accommodate a wide variety of data models. NoSQL stands for "not only SQL." It is an alternative to traditional relational databases in which data is placed in tables, and data schema is perfectly designed before the database is built.
           <br>
            
            NoSQL databases are useful for a large set of distributed data. <br>
            
            Some examples of NoSQL database system with their category are: <br>
            
            MongoDB, CouchDB, Cloudant (Document-based) <br>
            Memcached, Redis, Coherence (key-value store) <br>
            HBase, Big Table, Accumulo (Tabular) <br>
            
            
            Advantage of NoSQL <br>
            High Scalability <br>
            
            NoSQL can handle an extensive amount of data because of scalability. If the data grows, NoSQL database scale it to handle that data in an efficient manner.
            
            High Availability <br>
            
            NoSQL supports auto replication. Auto replication makes it highly available because, in case of any failure, data replicates itself to the previous consistent state.
            <br>
            Disadvantage of NoSQL <br>
            Open source <br>
            
            NoSQL is an open-source database, so there is no reliable standard for NoSQL yet. <br>
            
            Management challenge <br>
            
            Data management in NoSQL is much more complicated than relational databases.
            It is very challenging to install and even more hectic to manage daily. <br>
            
            GUI is not available <br>
            
            GUI tools for NoSQL database are not easily available in the market. <br>
            
            Backup <br>
            
            Backup is a great weak point for NoSQL databases. Some databases, like MongoDB, have no powerful approaches for data backup.
            <br>
            
            The Object-Oriented Databases <br>
            The object-oriented databases contain data in the form of object and classes. Objects are the real-world entity, and types are the collection of objects. An object-oriented database is a combination of relational model features with objects oriented principles. It is an alternative implementation to that of the relational model.
            <br>
            Object-oriented databases hold the rules of object-oriented programming. An object-oriented database management system is a hybrid application.
            <br>
            The object-oriented database model contains the following properties.
            <br>
            <u>Object-oriented programming properties</u>
            
            <br>
            1. Objects <br>
            2. Classes <br>
            3. Inheritance <br>
            4. Polymorphism <br>
            5. Encapsulation <br>

            <u>Relational database properties</u>  <br>
            
            
            1. Atomicity <br>
            2. Consistency <br>
            3. Integrity <br>
            4. Durability <br>
            5. Concurrency <br>
            6. Query processing <br>
            7. Graph Databases <br>
            A graph database is a NoSQL database. It is a graphical representation of data. It contains nodes and edges. A node represents an entity, and each edge represents a relationship between two edges. Every node in a graph database represents a unique identifier.
            
            Graph databases are beneficial for searching the relationship between data because they highlight the relationship between relevant data.

            Graph databases are very useful when the database contains a complex relationship and dynamic schema.
            
            It is mostly used in supply chain management, identifying the source of IP telephony.
            
            DBMS (Data Base Management System)
            Database management System is software which is used to store and retrieve the database. For example, Oracle, MySQL, etc.; these are some popular DBMS tools.
            
            DBMS provides the interface to perform the various operations like creation, deletion, modification, etc.
            DBMS allows the user to create their databases as per their requirement.
            DBMS accepts the request from the application and provides specific data through the operating system.
            DBMS contains the group of programs which acts according to the user instruction.
            It provides security to the database.

            Controls redundancy
            
            It stores all the data in a single database file, so it can control data redundancy.
            
            Data sharing
            
            An authorized user can share the data among multiple users.
            
            Backup
            
            It providesBackup and recovery subsystem. This recovery system creates automatic data from system failure and restores data if required.
            
            Multiple user interfaces

            It provides a different type of user interfaces like GUI, application interfaces.
            
            Disadvantage of DBMS
            Size
            
            It occupies large disk space and large memory to run efficiently.
            
            Cost
            
            DBMS requires a high-speed data processor and larger memory to run DBMS software, so it is costly.
            
            Complexity
            
            DBMS creates additional complexity and requirements.
            
            RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)
            The word RDBMS is termed as 'Relational Database Management System.' It is represented as a table that contains rows and column.
            
            RDBMS is based on the Relational model; it was introduced by E. F. Codd.
            
            A relational database contains the following components:
            
            Table
            Record/ Tuple
            Field/Column name /Attribute
            Instance
            Schema
            Keys
            An RDBMS is a tabular DBMS that maintains the security, integrity, accuracy, and consistency of the data.</p>

         <p class="passage" id="centralized">
            There are various types of databases used for storing different varieties of data: <br>

            1) Centralized Database <br>
            
            It is the type of database that stores data at a centralized database system. <br>
            It comforts the users to access the stored data from different locations through several applications. <br>
            These applications contain the authentication process to let users access data securely. <br>
            An example of a Centralized database can be Central Library that carries a central database of each library in a college/university. <br>
            
            Advantages of Centralized Database <br>
            
            It has decreased the risk of data management, i.e., manipulation of data will not affect the core data. <br>
            Data consistency is maintained as it manages data in a central repository. It provides better data quality, which enables organizations to establish data standards. <br>
             It is less costly because fewer vendors are required to handle the data <br>
            
            Disadvantages of Centralized Database <br>
            
            1) The size of the centralized database is large, which increases the response time for fetching the data. <br>
            2) It is not easy to update such an extensive database system. <br>
            3) If any server failure occurs, entire data will be lost, which could be a huge loss.

         <p class="passage">
           <p class="passage" id="distributed">2) Distributed  <br>

Unlike a centralized database system, in distributed systems, data is distributed among different database systems of an organization.
 These database systems are connected via communication links. Such links help the end-users to access the data easily.
  Examples of the Distributed database are Apache Cassandra, HBase, Ignite, etc. <br>

We can further divide a distributed database system into: <br>
1) Homogeneous DDB: Those database systems which execute on the same operating system and use the same application process and carry the same hardware devices. <br>
2) Heterogeneous DDB: Those database systems which execute on different operating systems under different application procedures, and carries different hardware devices. <br>

Advantages of Distributed Database <br>

1)Modular development is possible in a distributed database, i.e., the system can be expanded by including new computers and connecting them to the distributed system.  <br>
2) One server failure will not affect the entire data set. <br>
3) Relational Database <br>



This database is based on the relational data model, which stores data in the form of rows(tuple) and columns(attributes), and together forms a table(relation).
 A relational database uses SQL for storing, manipulating, as well as maintaining the data. E.F. Codd invented the database in 1970. Each table in the database carries a key that makes the data unique from others.
  Examples of Relational databases are MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, etc. <br> </p>

           <p class="passage"  id="relational">4) NoSQL Database <br>

            Non-SQL/Not Only SQL is a type of database that is used for storing a wide range of data sets. <br>
            It is not a relational database as it stores data not only in tabular form but in several different ways. <br>
            
            It came into existence when the demand for building modern applications increased. <br>
            Thus, NoSQL presented a wide variety of database technologies in response to the demands <br>
            
            We can further divide a NoSQL database into the following four types: <br>
            
            1) Key-value storage: It is the simplest type of database storage where it stores every single item as a key (or attribute name) holding its value, together. <br>
            2) Document-oriented Database: A type of database used to store data as JSON-like document. <br>
            3) It helps developers in storing data by using the same document-model format as used in the application code. <br>
            4) Graph Databases: It is used for storing vast amounts of data in a graph-like structure. Most commonly, social networking websites use the graph database. <br>
            5) Wide-column stores: It is similar to the data represented in relational databases. Here, data is stored in large columns together, instead of storing in rows. <br>
            
            Advantages of NoSQL Database <br>
            
            1) It enables good productivity in the application development as it is not required to store data in a structured format.  <br>
            2) It is a better option for managing and handling large data sets. <br>
            
            3) It provides high scalability. Users can quickly access data from the database through key-value. <br>
